            <p>Now that you have created your survey, it is time to decide its visibility. If you choose to make it public, anyone will be able to access it and participate, allowing you to get a variety of opinions. On the other hand, if you decide to keep it private, only the people you directly invite will be able to respond, which is ideal for more specific or exclusive surveys. 
              Select the option that best suits your needs and start collecting responses.
